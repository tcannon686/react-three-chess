react-three-chess is a simple chess app created to learn about how to use
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and other
technologies like Redis, Express, and react-spring. The app is currently hosted
on heroku, and you can play it [here](https://react-three-chess.herokuapp.com)!
